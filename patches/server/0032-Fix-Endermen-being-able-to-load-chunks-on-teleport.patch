Subject: [PATCH] Fix Endermen being able to load chunks on teleport

Vanilla behaviour is quite odd: If an Enderman teleports into a chunk
 which was unloaded and gets loaded by the Enderman and then the chunk
 unloads again the Enderman will be immediately removed (unless they
 have a custom name) so the chunk load was pointless. To keep Vanilla
 behaviour the Enderman just gets removed directly.
