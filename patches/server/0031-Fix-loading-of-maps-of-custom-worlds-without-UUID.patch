Subject: [PATCH] Fix loading of maps of custom worlds without UUID

This apparently happens with some maps that were created with some
 really old versions of CraftBukkit which didn't use/store world UUIDs.

We just load them with an unknown dimension key and don't care about
 assigning them to a specific world. This might still break more
 advanced functionality but at least allows loading them with plugins
 and they might even display their content?
